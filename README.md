## Welcome to Convex

**Convex is the reactive backend-as-a-service for web developers.**

Convex makes it dead simple to store your app's shared state and sync it
everywhere. As a developer, you interact with your shared state using JavaScript
or TypeScript functions and bind that state to your reactive app.

Realtime updates are automatic. Every user everywhere sees the current version
of your state.

Convex is fully serverless and automatically handles caching and scaling.

**Get started at [docs.convex.dev](https://docs.convex.dev)!**

This repo contains demo apps to get you started with the Convex platform.
